* Code challenge - BST
** Summary
   
   Your company needs you to implement a Binary Search Tree (BST), using the language of your choice.
   Your solution will be utilized by several different teams throughout your organization.
   Initially, this BST only needs to support integers. 
   
** Requirements:
   
*** DONE The BST must be built from a list of integers.
*** DONE Implement a method that returns the deepest nodes in the BST along with their depth
   
** Example:
   
   Input: 12,11,90,82,7,9
   Output: deepest, 9; depth, 3
  
** What we are looking for:
*** DONE Correctness - will your solution produce the desired results?
*** DONE Conciseness - does your solution balance clarity and brevity?
*** DONE Maintainability - does your code stand up to changing needs?
*** DONE Anti-patterns - does your solution avoid anti-patterns?

** Testing

   #+begin_src shell
     docker-compose up
   #+end_src
